		<div id="introHeader">Darwin Rockets</div>

		<div class="introBody">Darwin Rockets is a genetic algorithms program. Each round, rockets try to fly from the bottom of the screen to the green target, avoiding the obstacles in the way. Each Rocket is given a "flight plan" detailed in it's DNA, described as a series of degree turns.</div>

		<div class="introBody">When the rockets start out, they're dumb. Their flight plans are generated at random, and none reach the target. However, using principles found in Darwinian evolution, the rockets with the best flight plans survive to create new "child" rockets.</div>

		<div class="introBody">Over time, you'll notice subsequent rocket populations getting better and better. Eventually, the population will not only reach the target, but will do it quickly and efficiently.</div>
